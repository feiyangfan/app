## Project: my website

This is a website I am trying to make, I have no prior web development knowledge and will be learning as I making the website.


## Features

1. Todo list: A simple todo list that the user can add, delete, edit a todo event. The user can also create new todo lists
2. Go train schedule:
3. Timetable:
4. Homepage:

## How to use



## What I learned
1. **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
3. simple way to know what can. 
2. Use {} to use javascript in jsx
3. Use array.map() to map over elements and push out unique items
4. Css flexbox is powerful and useful!
