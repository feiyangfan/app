## Features

1. Todo list: 
2. Go train schedule:

## How to use



## What I learned
1. **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
3. simple way to know what can. 
2. Use {} to use javascript in jsx
3. Use array.map() to map over elements and push out unique items


## Development logs

1. Move old basic website into a seperate folder, re-make all website using **react**.
