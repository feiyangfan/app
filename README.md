## Project: my website

This is a simple website app I am trying to make. I will be building frontend, backend, and a datebase for it. I have no prior web development knowledge and will be learning and record useful things I learned as I am making the website.


## Features

1. Todo list: The user can add, delete, edit an event. The user can also create new todo lists, and add events to them.
2. Timetable: A timetable that the user can add new events at different timeslots, edit added events, and delete unwanted events.
3. Homepage: The homepage will display current time, date, and weather at the top. Also several display cards that display information from todo list and timetable.
4. Maybe more features to be added in the future.

## How to use



## What I learned
* **Frontend**:
1. **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
3. simple way to know what can. 
2. Use {} to use javascript in jsx
3. Use array.map() to map over elements and push out unique items
4. Css flexbox is powerful and useful!
