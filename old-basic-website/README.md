### Project: my-first-website  
A website I am trying to make, I have no prior web development knowledge and will be learning as I make the website. 

### Features: 
1. **homepage**: display current user name, time, date, weather, and todo-list/go-schedule/next-event-reminder card that user made<br>
2. **todo-list**: users can create multiple todo lists, add/remove/complete events, edit contents, they are able to access events even after refresh page(store in db)<br>
3. **go-schedule**: users can search for a train line, display choosen line's schedule, includes next arrival time, depature time<br>
4. **timetable**: users can import time table using iso file, or add own event at a time slot.<br>
5. **settings**: users are able to change theme(maybe?)

### What I learned:
* **frontend**: basic **html/css/javascript** and **react** as **frontend library/framework**  
* **Backend**: **node.js** and **express** as **backend framwork**  
* **general**: nvm, npm. Backend should be responsidble for data related, like data validation, storage, access
