### Frontend for my-website

### Three parts:
1. Homepage
2. Todo list
3. Timetable

### Learned from develop frontend 
1. **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
3. simple way to know what can. 
2. Use {} to use javascript in jsx
3. Use array.map() to map over elements and push out unique items
4. Css flexbox is powerful and useful!
