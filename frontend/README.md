### Learned from develop frontend 

2. Use **{js}** to use javascript in jsx
3. **array.map()** to map over elements and push out unique items, use **...** to copy over original array.
4. Css flexbox 
6. **const [A, setA] = useState(type)** is one of the most important things in react.
7.  **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
