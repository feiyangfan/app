### Frontend for my-daily-planner

### Three parts:
1. Homepage
2. Todo list
3. Timetable

### Libraries, frameworks, and packages used:
1. React
2. Material UI
3. UUID
4. axios
5. dotenv
6. react-router

### Learned from develop frontend 

2. Use **{js}** to use javascript in jsx
3. **array.map()** to map over elements and push out unique items, use **...** to copy over original array.
4. Css flexbox 
6. **const [A, setA] = useState(type)** is one of the most important things in react.
7.  **prop**: used to pass data between components, but can only pass down data
2. **state**: components will react and rerender based on **state**. **state** is dependent on components and can also only be passed down via **props**
6. **useEffect(() => {},[])** can be used to render/use components/functions on first load.
7. **uuid** package to add unique id to items
8. Make sure the user readbility is good
9. Make use of react-based UI frameworks such as @material-ui is good because it decreases the time spending on making components and make develop much more efficient.
10. Make use of previously designed components whenever possible, this significally decreases development time and increase efficiency.
